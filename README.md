## Usage

### Install Vagrant 1.5:
[http://vagrantup.com](http://vagrantup.com)

### Install VirtualBox:
[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## Setup Option 1: Box

```
mkdir DIR && cd DIR
vagrant init cbumgard/golang
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

Done!

For more see: [https://vagrantcloud.com/cbumgard/golang](https://vagrantcloud.com/cbumgard/golang)

## Setup Option 2: Vagrantfile

```
git clone git@github.com:cbumgard/golang-vagrant.git
cd golang-vagrant
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

Done! 

### Optional:

```sudo ./install_vagrant_sudoers.sh```

This prevents Vagrant asking you to auth as sudo on ```vagrant up``` for fast NFS file sync.

This box synchronizes your home ```~``` directory on your host to to ```/host/``` on the guest VM so you can use your local code in the VM. It uses NFS to make the file sync much faster than default, and this requires you to enter your password when starting/stopping the machine. You can disable if you want by changing the Vagrantfile from:

```config.vm.synced_folder "~/", "/host", nfs: true```

to:

```config.vm.synced_folder "~/", "/host"```

### For Git:

You'll need to generate an SSH key in the VM and add it to your GitHub account before you can push from within the VM. So inside the Vagrant VM follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys).

Then copy the contents of ```~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``` into [https://github.com/settings/ssh](https://github.com/settings/ssh)

### Vagrant user

By default the ```vagrant``` user is configured with password 'vagrant'. The vagrant user is also configured for password-less sudo.

### Edit code on host machine, build in VM

Your ```~/``` home directory on your host machine is synced to the ```/host/``` directory inside of Vagrant. So for example you can edit code in ```~/code/``` on your laptop and build it inside a Vagrant shell inside ```/host/code```.

### Networking:

Configured for private network on static IP: ```192.168.33.100```, with port ```:5000``` forwarded.
